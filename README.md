# MovieSentiment-NLP: Text Analysis for Reviews

MovieSentiment-NLP is an advanced toolkit tailored for sentiment analysis on IMDB movie reviews. Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and various machine learning techniques, it transforms raw movie review data into actionable insights on sentiments.

## How it Works
MovieSentiment-NLP encompasses several key stages:
1. **Preprocessing**: Cleansing and preparation of raw text data, including HTML tag removal, stemming, and stopwords removal.
2. **Vectorization**: Transformation of cleaned text into numerical vectors using Bag-of-Words and TF-IDF techniques.
3. **Model Training**: Utilization of machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Linear SVM, and Multinomial Naive Bayes for training on preprocessed data.
4. **Prediction and Evaluation**: Application of trained models to predict sentiments on test data, evaluated through accuracy, classification reports, and confusion matrices.

## Instructions for Use
1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local system.
2. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure the required libraries, such as pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, NLTK, BeautifulSoup, and WordCloud, are installed.
3. **Prepare Data**: Place your IMDB reviews dataset in the designated directory or update the path accordingly in the code.
4. **Run the Script**: Execute the provided Python script to commence sentiment analysis.
5. **Analyze Results**: Review the output for detailed insights into sentiments, visualizations, and performance metrics.
